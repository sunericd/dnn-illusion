# ImageNet-trained deep neural network exhibits illusion-like response to the Scintillating Grid

This repository contains the image stimuli used for the analyses in the aforementioned paper along with all of the resulting output files (representational dissimilarity values across layers):
- "results" contains several output files; includes some files not used in the analyses; organized into "vgg19" and "resnet101"
- "stimuli" contains the sets of image stimuli for each experiment

The file name convention for the stimuli set is:
- "SG" = Scintillating Grid
- "HG" = Hermann Grid
- One-pixel dot border unless otherwise specified as "BorderN" where N is the width of the border in pixels.
